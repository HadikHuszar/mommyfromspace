        <h3>How It All Started</h3>

          >Have you ever wondered what messages people would send into space?</b
        >
        As part of Twilio's Historic Mission to Send Code to space, they teamed
        up with the Talon Space Mission team to accomplish this ambitious, yet
        exciting, goal during Twilio's 2021 SIGNAL event. <br />
        <br />TwilioQuest 3.2 launched at SIGNAL this year, and they wanted to
        do something big to celebrate. SIGNAL attendees had the
        once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to send some code to space aboard Talon
        1, a balloon designed to send a camera-equipped Raspberry Pi into near
        Earth orbit. When in space, Talon 1 took video of the community membersâ€™
        code submissions executing against the backdrop of space. <br />

        I sent a message to my daughter, telling her I loved her.

        <h3>My Message</h3>
        It said: "Hello Ziza this is Mommy Saying 'I Love You' from Space."
